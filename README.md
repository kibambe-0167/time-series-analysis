# to do
- linear regression of any features
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA): A weighted moving average that gives more weight to recent observations.


Volatility measures:
- Historical volatility
- Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) volatility
- Rolling Standard Deviation: Measures the variability of the time series over a rolling window, capturing changes in volatility.
- Coefficient of Variation (CV): The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, useful for comparing the degree of variation relative to the mean.

Lag Plot: A scatter plot of the time series against a lagged version of itself, used to identify patterns and relationships.

Cross-Correlation: Measures the correlation between two time series at different lags, useful for identifying lead-lag relationships.

Autoregressive (AR) Coefficients: Coefficients from fitting an autoregressive model, which captures the relationship between an observation and a number of lagged observations.

CUSUM (Cumulative Sum Control Chart): Identifies shifts in the mean level of the time series.
Bayesian Change Point Detection: Identifies structural changes in the time series using a probabilistic approach.
